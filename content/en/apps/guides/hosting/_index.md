 Guides for hosting, maintaining, and monitoring CHT applications
---

Before beggining any of these guide, be sure to meet all of the [CHT hosting requirements]({{< relref "apps/guides/hosting/requirements" >}}) first.

To host a production instance of the CHT, use either the [AWS]({{< relref "apps/guides/hosting/ec2-setup-guide" >}}) or [Self]({{< relref "apps/guides/hosting/self-hosting" >}}) hosting guides. To do app development, see our [App Developer]({{< relref "apps/guides/hosting/app-developer" >}}) hosting guide.

To get an overview on how these hosting solutions use `docker` and `docker-compose`, be sure to read the [guide on a local CHT setup]({{< relref "apps/tutorials/local-setup" >}}).
