## Purpose Of the Guide

The tutorial will take you through mapping of users on CHT hierarchy, including:

- Defining the hierarchy (reporting structure)
- Defining user roles
- Mapping user personas to the CHT hierarchy

## Brief Overview of Key Concepts

A *[user persona]({{< ref "design/personas" >}})* is a generalized character that embodies a particular type of user.

User roles are the activities that the user personas are expected to carry out.

A hierarchy represents the reporting structure.

## Prerequisites/Required Resources

[Personas.]({{< ref "design/personas" >}})

## Steps

In this section, you will define a hierarchy, define user persona roles and map user personas to the hierarchy.

### 1. Define the Hierarchy

Identify reporting structure of the user personas in order to have a flawless flow of data from one level to another.

For instance, a family member is part of a household. A household and CHWs are part of a CHW area. A CHW area and nurses are part of a health facility. Additional levels may be added as needed. The admin level operates outside of the hierarchy and gives access to all levels and people.

The app hierarchy is often modeled after the health system, health program or community structure. All people who are registered in the app must be associated with a place. These places are located in a hierarchy to other places.
