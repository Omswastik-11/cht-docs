## Purpose Of the Tutorial

This guide will take you through creation of personas from user research results as a way of synthesizing information.

## Background

When you’re in the beginning stages of your design project and you have just finished some highly informative interviews and observations in the context of your users, your head is full of impressions. You have a feeling for the different types of users who exist, and you have heard some similarities in their stories that you feel should guide the design process. But how do you get these impressions out, into the minds of your co-designers and the client? Personas are very powerful tools that will help you do just that. They are commonly used by design teams around the world, and have been proven to be very effective.

## Brief Overview of Key Concepts

User persona is a generalized character that embodies a particular type of user.

## Steps

### 1. Identify Elements to Include in a Persona

There are six common pieces of information that make up a persona:

- Name, age, gender, and an image of the persona, preferably including some context in the background
- A tag line, indicating what the persona does or considers relevant in his or her life
- The experience and relevant skills the persona has in the area of the product or service you will be developing
- Some context to indicate how he/she would interact with your product or service (e.g., the voluntariness of use, frequency of use, and preferred device)
- Any goals, attitudes, and concerns he/she would have when using your product or service
- Quotes or a brief scenario, that indicate the persona’s attitude toward the product or service you’re designing. If the persona already uses an existing product or service to meet his or her needs, you might describe the use of that here

### 2. Create the Right Balance Between Research Data and Fictional Details

It’s important to pick precisely the right information to show in a persona. To do that, you only have to decide if a piece of information is relevant when making a design decision. This ensures the credibility and applicability of the information gathered about a user.

Below is an example of a persona that shows the six main elements you should include. Name, age, gender, tag line, experience, and skills are placed on the left-hand side. The middle column focuses on the context to indicate how - in this case - she would interact with a product or service. Finally, on the right-hand side, some goals and concerns are shared, as well as a short scenario to indicate the persona’s attitude.
